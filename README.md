# PackSourceCodeIntoZIP

Pack Source Code into ZIP WITHOUT binaries and other artifacts

1. Run this script as admin to register this script in Registry as Windows Explorer Command for Directories
2. Now run the script from the Windows Explorer on any directory containing code :-)

You can configure the Directories and files to exclude within the script ($excludeDirs, $excludeFile)
You can configure an optional Readme file to add to all ZIP ($readmeToAdd)
